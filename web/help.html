        <h2><a name="config">Configuration</a></h2>
		<p>The config file is used to store user defined variables, allowing you to change file paths, and enable / disable options</p>
		<p>Most of the configuration settings use a 1 or a 0 to Enable or Disable options.</p>
		<p>Here are the items that can be configured</p>
		<li>transferDir This is the temporary directory where uplaoded files are stored before processing
		<li>reportRoot, This is the directory that will store any files associated with a submitted task
		<li>DBFile, This is the location of the SQLITE database file. This config setting will allow for otehr SQL varients in the future
		<li>ProxyPort and SSLPort used for parsing the HTTP Traffic, if your not using a proxy use '0080' and '443'
		<li>ssdeep, Enable or Disable SSDEEP Hashing
		<li>clamscan and dblocation will set the Definition location and enable scanning of all attathments and http objects
		<li>enableYara speaks for itself. emailSig and fileSig set the file location for your Yara Rules

        <h2><a name="import">Submitting Tasks</a></h2>
		<h3>Emails</h3>
		<p>Email Tasks can be submitted in one of the following formats
		<li>PCAP File containing a single or multiple SMTP streams
		<li> Text Stream containg RFC 882 or equivelent stream
		<li>POP3 or IMAP Protocols, IMAP supports Defining a Folder, POP just process the Inbox.
		<h3>HTTP Traffic</h3>
		<p>Before submitting HTTP PCAP files it is important to ensure the Proxy Port settings are configured correctly in the Config File</p>
		<p>The submitted file MUST be name http-xxxx.pcap, where xxxx can be any string.</p>
		<p>There is currently NO progress bar to indicate the processing of HTTP traffic. This process can be time consuming for Large PCAP files.</p>
		<h3>Other Tasking</h3>
		<p>When submittign other Taskings. i.e. files that can not be parsed by the DB, First compress the files in to a single Zip, RAR, or tar.gz file.</p>
		<p>The submitted file MUST be nameed Tasking-xxxx, where xxxx can be any string.</p>
		<p>Submit the file using the upload form and add a comment appropriate to the Task. e.g Tasking-Department Name</p>

		
		<p>For all submitted tasks there is an optional field Called Comments. This can be used to add a Tag that is used as par tof the reporting process.
 This tag uses the keyword 'Tasking' to produce reports. </p>
		<p>Any other keyword can be used e.g. a Snort Rule Name that will be searchable using the search Options</p>
		<p>Example 1: A snort Signature for an email </p>
		<p>Example 2: Emails submitted from another source - 'Tasking-PhishingSamples'
